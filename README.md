#**Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning**


###**Overview**


This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to build a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions and minimize false positives.


###**Dataset**


The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of all transactions.
